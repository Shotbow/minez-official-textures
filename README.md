# The Library - Official MineZ Resource Pack
Provides a Vanilla+ resource pack for the MineZ gamemode, relying heavily on Optifine's CIT system. The pack contains original custom textures for almost all legendary items, unique items, enchanted items, potions, and more. 

## Installation
1. Download the latest version of the pack from the "Releases" corresponding to your Minecraft version. 
2. Put the zip file in the "resourcepacks" folder of your Minecraft instance.
3. Move it to the right-hand column of the resource pack selection screen in-game. For best results ensure the pack is at the top of the list of active resource packs.

## Addon Packs
With each release there are additional packs aside from the main one. These addon packs modify the main pack or the MineZ experience. The goal of these is to provide additional customization for the user. To use any of the addon packs, follow the installation instructions for the main pack, and then set it above the main pack in the list of active resource packs.

Addon packs are universally compatibile unless otherwise specified.

### Available Addon Packs
- Classic MineZ Textures: Overrides many of the textures with the original ones by Rose and Seal.
- Fishing Pack: Changes the water splash texture from blue to yellow, to make fishing splashes much more visible.
- Food Overlay Pack: Overlays the total hunger/saturation value of most MineZ foods. (Comes in 2 variants depending on where the overlay shows.)
- Glint Reducer: Reduces the strength of the glint on enchanted items and potions by about 50%. _(1.15+ only)_
- Improved Paintings Pack: Significantly improves the quality of all paintings. _(Meme pack, not an official pack)_
- Inventory Pack: Adds an underlay to inventories for faster item sorting.
- Red Sandstone Slab Pack: Makes the bottom of red sandstone slabs less red.
- Vanilla Override Pack: Sets all normal items to their vanilla 1.12 textures.

## Modifying the Pack
To modify the pack, you have 2 options:

- You can unzip the main pack and edit the desired textures/files directly, and using the folder as the pack.
- You can create a copy of the pack, unzip that, delete everything but the things you want to modify, modify those, and then put that unzipped modified folder above the zipped pack in the texture pack order.

The first option is less work up front, but more work in the future whenever you update the pack. The second option is more work up front, but very little work going forward. It depends how often you plan to update the pack. Whichever way you chose, there are plenty of tutorials online, and you can use the main pack as a template.
